# rofi-podcast
A rofi menu to browse and play podcasts from [rss.com](https://rss.com/community/).
History of played podcasts is kept in ~/.cache and can be browsed selecting the "Recently Played" entry in the categories menu.
A python script using requests and lxml modules is provided to scrape the website when new series are added.
Series episodes are fetched every time a serie is selected, so they will be always up to date.
